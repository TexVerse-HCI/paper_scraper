ABSTRACT 
We present bYOB (Build Your Own Bag), a flexible, 
computationally enhanced modular textile system from which to 
construct smart fabric objects.  bYOB was motivated by a desire 
to transform everyday surfaces into ambient displays for 
information and to make building with fabric as easy as playing 
with Lego blocks.  In the realm of personal architecture, bYOB is 
an interactive material that encourages users to explore and 
experiment by creating new objects to seamlessly integrate into 
their lives. The physical configuration of the object mediates its 
computational behavior.  Therefore, an object built out of the 
system of modular elements understands its geometry and 
responds appropriately without any end-user programming.  Our 
current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands 
it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, 
responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the 
sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects 
placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech. We 
describe how bYOB contributes to and differs from existing work 
in modular based systems and fabric interfaces.  We discuss our 
development process in respect to physical, electronic, and 
conceptual design.  We also describe salient features and future 
applications enabled by this new construction kit.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
bYOB’s significance is that anyone can make an object at any 
time and anywhere whether they are a designer with a new vision, 
an office worker in need of additional light, or a student who 
needs useful information while in transit but does not want to 
carry several additional electronic devices.  Therefore, the 
modules allow users to express themselves and create interactions 
with their environment.  Rather than needing to carry several 
electronic devices to access these applications, bYOB exploits 
everyday surfaces as a natural medium by which to communicate 
information.

capability. 
On a conceptual level, bYOB seeks to challenge the conventional 
ways in which technology, its producers, and the role of the 
intended ‘beneficiary’ or user, are viewed; the common notion that 
the technology dictates how we use it obscures its potential as an 
interactive outlet.  By using a modular textile system, the user is 
not divorced from the creative process.  The human computer 
interaction that is afforded is one that is aware of the changing 
needs and capabilities of people and environments, yet is dually 
cognizant of a wider creative evolution.   
1
When designing applications for bYOB, we were inspired by the 
lifestyles of today’s students and professionals.  Our target 
audience can be characterized in part by their mobility — 
constantly moving between home, work, school and personal 
commitments.  As a responsive tangible interface, bYOB can be 
customized to fit their unique needs.  For example, a set of bYOB 
modules may be physically configured into a window shade or 
lighting fixture in the office and later be reconfigured into a bag or 
scarf to aid the user in transit.  
1.1  Current Applications 
Environmental Awareness. bYOB modules are equipped with 
sensors to respond to changes in, for example, light level and 
temperature. Our current prototype illuminates the contents of the 
bag when ambient illumination drops below a desirable level. 
Object Detection. Using radio frequency identification, bYOB 
modules can detect whether or not important objects (e.g. cell 
phones, wallets) are nearby and alert the user, through the fabric’s 
ambient light display or using speech, if the items are missing.  
For example, a bYOB-constructed bag will light up to inform the 
user if he or she tries to leave home without keys. 
Topology Mapping.  The modules are dynamically aware of their 
configuration and understand geometries other than those of bags.  
A wall hanging may be configured and act as a light source or a 
curtain may be constructed to respond appropriately to 
environmental changes (Fig 2). 
1.2  Applications Under Development  
Wireless Capability.  Using the Bluetooth protocol, bYOB 
modules will be able to download information from the Internet 
(e.g. weather forecasts) to the modules.  Additionally, the user will 
have the ability to ‘log in’ to one or more remote bYOB bags from 
a computer and search for the location of items. 
Network Detection.  Mobile lifestyles often lead to increased use 
of mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants) and laptop 
computers.  However, the wireless networks used with these items 
are not immediately visible.  Through the ambient display, bYOB 
modules can make information regarding the existence and 
strength of networks readily available. 
Seamless Integration Into Our Lives. We envision that when you 
hang your bag up for the day, it will automatically recharge its 
battery and synchronize itself with other objects in the bYOB 
network. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
There are several examples of modular based computational 
interfaces developed for various applications that have informed 
our research.  One such system, Triangles [2], used for non-linear 
storytelling but available for other applications, most closely 
parallels bYOB in its ability to allow users to handle and 
manipulate digital information with construction pieces.   While 
both Triangles and bYOB serve as displays for information, the 
modules of bYOB are used to transform familiar physical 
surfaces, and the technology is specifically designed for use as a 
flexible fabric interface. 
Wifisense, a wearable scanner for wireless networks, is a self-
contained handbag that conveys WiFi availability through a 
pattern of light and sound. [5] Unlike Wifisense, bYOB’s design 
approach is of embedding systemic behavior inside modules of 
fabric to provide a novel approach for building objects.  
Additionally, bYOB creations can serve multiple purposes over a 
wide range of applications, not limited to the interface of a bag.  
E-broidery or conductive fabric was examined as a possible prior 
work to build on.  E-broidery is attractive in its ability to replace 
standard circuitry with flexible, washable substrates.  After 
examination into the current state of conductive threads however, 
we discovered that the integrity of the threads is in question as 
they may be apt to break when subjected to stress.  Additionally, 
we learned that they must endure a lengthy process of welding and 
sewing.  An alternate design used in bYOB achieves similar 
freedom of movement without laborious manufacturing processes, 
an important requirement since many bYOB modules must be 
fabricated.  Nonetheless, E-broidery remains a subject of study 
and further research is being done to investigate whether or not it 
is possible to replace some of the wiring with conductive fabric 
traces [4]. 
bYOB’s contribution marries notions of ambient communication 
with tangible media to allow for the creation of personal 
architecture.  It encourages rapid exploration in the manipulation 
of fabric and is a universal approach because it assumes no formal 
design training and little computational experience.  The ‘digital 
language’ expressed by the object is made unambiguous because 
the user is in control of the physical form and light pattern display. 
3.  PHYSICAL DESIGN  
The current bYOB prototype consists of squares and equilateral 
triangles approximately 4"x4" and no more than 1/8" thick. The 
simple geometries of squares and triangles were chosen because 
they are easily recognizable and can be effortlessly manipulated 
into two and three-dimensional shapes.  Additionally, the 
dimensions were chosen to fit comfortably when grasped by the 
human hand. 
 
Figure 2:  bYOB can detect environmental changes 
actuated through ambient light display. 
The task of constructing a connection to fit securely and easily 
with neighboring modules as well as transmit data and power 
posed a significant challenge in the development process.  Several 
approaches for the modules’ physical connectors were examined 
including snap-hinges, screws, zippers, and magnetic/metal snaps.  
At first, we choose commercial metal snap connectors acquired 
from a fabric store because of their unambiguous design and their 
performance as conductors.  The snaps were disappointing 
because their aggregate weight compromised the feel of the fabric.  
Our current prototype employs conductive hook-and-loop material 
that is lightweight and has impressively low resistance, allowing 
data to be exchanged between modules.  The simplicity of 
 
 
2
snapping pieces together with hook-and-loop allows the user to, at 
any time, add or subtract modules from an object to fulfill a 
situational change or geometric design.  Additional time was spent 
ensuring that the male/female snaps on each module were part of 
an intuitive design where the user would not have to understand 
the technical complexities of lining up power, ground, and data 
pins (Fig 3).  
Lightweight foam padding inside each module provides 
cushioning 
against 
the 
electronics. 
 
We 
are 
currently 
experimenting with different types of synthetic and natural fabrics 
for the outside of bYOB module shells.  The material must be 
weather proof and have the ability to dissipate light from the 
LEDs.  However, the fabric we are looking at is merely a 
suggestion of what the object might look like.  Using the 
innovative Dual Lock material by 3M stitched to the outside of the 
modules as well as to the fabric, users have the ability to 
constantly change the fabric coverings of their objects. 
4.  TECHNICAL DESIGN 
The system is comprised of three different types of modules: 
passives, actives, and parents.  Active and parent modules contain 
an array of sensors, light actuating elements and a microprocessor. 
Passive modules, while physically identical on the exterior to the 
active modules, have the sole purpose of contributing structural 
support and physical form and therefore contain no light actuation 
or computational capabilities. 
The parent module differs from the actives in that it controls the 
algorithm to equip the rest of the modules with appropriate 
applications.  The shape of the parent module is dependent on the 
object created.  For example, if the user builds a bag, the handle is 
designated the parent and alerts its children that they are part of a 
bag and should respond correspondingly (with object and network 
detection applications).   
To ensure that bYOB is not cost-prohibitive as an end-user 
technology, emphasis was placed on using inexpensive electronics 
and on power conservation.  The current design of each active 
module houses a 1-inch square printed circuit board covered in 
epoxy resin to level height and imbued with modest processing to 
locally manage communication, actuator response, and its own 
unique identity.  The PIC16F876 microcontroller was chosen 
because of its low current consumption and because it works well 
with the I2C bus, the network by which a mesh of modules 
communicate.  I2C was chosen because of its minimal cost and its 
plug and play ability. [3] For actuation, each active module uses 
RGB LEDs (light emitting diodes) to illuminate the fabric that 
covers the board.  With several illuminated active modules, an 
ambient light pattern emerges.   
For greatest efficiency and to conserve space, it was decided that 
data and power would be distributed through the network of 
modules. The conductive hook-and-loop material that acts as a 
mechanical connection between pieces also transmits power and 
data through the object.  Four connections on each side provide 
power, ground, and the data and clock connections required by the 
I2C bus.  As discovered in the research of Computational Building 
Blocks, a building kit for geometric modeling, using self-powered 
modules would greatly increase the cost and maintenance of each 
piece within the construction kit. [1] Instead, power is currently 
drawn from a centralized rechargeable battery piece. During 
development of the modules, emphasis was made on minimizing 
power consumption: the microprocessor in each module draws 
less than 1 mA (milli-ampere), and high-brightness low-current 
LEDs were chosen to maximize light output while keeping current 
draw low. 
The current bYOB module implementation accommodates 
transducers and sensors for light and temperature and actuators for 
speech allowing interaction with the user in a natural way.   
Modules can be outfitted with additional sensors to respond to 
pressure and orientation.

Given the negligible size of the circuit board, the use of fabric-
based connectors and flexible cable, and the cushioning provided 
by the foam-fabric combination, modules effectively mask their 
technical belly, preventing them from coming into contact with the

user’s body.  In subsequent designs we expect to see a decrease in 
the size and weight of each module’s inner contents thus 
increasing usability. 
The user-interface is constantly being refined so that bYOB 
couples seamlessly with the kinds of interaction we are already 
accustomed to.  As part of a distributed sensor network, we 
envision several bYOB objects that synchronize with each other 
and facilitate visual data exchange.  A bYOB curtain would 
respond to changes in weather like the onset of rain and dually 
inform a bYOB bag that it should contain an umbrella. 
Additionally, by using waterproof fabric and electronics covered 
in epoxy we ensure that the modules are durable and washable. 
5.  EVALUATION 
An important part of our development process is feedback from 
potential users of bYOB.  We conducted a survey with local 
college students to find out what information and objects 
constructed out of bYOB would be most useful and what the 
strengths and weaknesses of the project were.

8.  ADDITIONAL AUTHORS 
Our respondents showed enthusiasm for this application, 
particularly its ability to light up at night and alert users of missing 
items.  There was concern about the durability of the system.  If 
they were to invest in bYOB as a product, they would want to 
ensure that it would last a long time.  Taking this feedback into 
account, we are developing physical connections that have 
negligible wear over time and looking into materials that are 
weather-resistant.

Furthermore, while almost all of our respondents considered 
themselves creative and said they would enjoy building objects 
with bYOB, they voiced concern about the time commitment 
bYOB might require.  In response, we are refining the design to 
ensure that physical connections are minimal and work 
effortlessly.  As the project progresses, we will continue to gather 
user feedback and observational data from a wider demographic.

6.  FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS 
Through further development, we hope to better understand 
bYOB’s challenges and limitations.  It is likely that we will 
confront the challenge of making the modules scalable to 
accommodate shapes and sizes different from triangles and 
squares of uniform size.  Because it is a textile that can be used for 
interiors, bags and accessories, it is crucial that the system is 
aesthetically appealing to users, allows freedom in design, and 
durable enough to withstand frequent use.
