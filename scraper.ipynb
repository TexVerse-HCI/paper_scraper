      "Group exercise has multiple benefits including greater adherence to fitness regimens, increased enjoyment among participants, and enhanced workout intensity. While a large number of technology tools have emerged to support real-time feedback of individual performance, tools to support group fitness are limited. In this paper, we present a set of wearable e-textile displays for running groups called Social Fabric Fitness (SFF). SFF provides a glanceable, shared screen on the back of the wearer's shirt to increase awareness and motivation of group fitness performance. We discuss parallel prototyping of three designs-one flexible e-ink and two flexible LED-based displays; the selection and refinement of one design; and two evaluations'a field study of 10 running groups and two case studies of running races. Our qualitative findings indicate that SFF improves awareness of individual and group performance, helps groups stay together, and improves in-situ motivation.

Based on expert interviews, we discerned goals for a persuasive game to create awareness about issues in traditional textile production. Textile Manager presents a proof-of-concept prototype that was evaluated with a pre-post exposure study.

      "Our studies have shown that as displays become larger, users leave more windows open for easy multitasking. A larger number of windows, however, may increase the time that users spend arranging and switching between tasks. We present Scalable Fabric, a task management system designed to address problems with the proliferation of open windows on the PC desktop. Scalable Fabric couples window management with a flexible visual representation to provide a focus-plus-context solution to desktop complexity. Users interact with windows in a central focus region of the display in a normal manner, but when a user moves a window into the periphery, it shrinks in size, getting smaller as it nears the edge of the display. The window \"minimize\" action is redefined to return the window to its preferred location in the periphery, allowing windows to remain visible when not in use. Windows in the periphery may be grouped together into named tasks, and task switching is accomplished with a single mouse click. The spatial arrangement of tasks leverages human spatial memory to make task switching easier. We review the evolution of Scalable Fabric over three design iterations, including discussion of results from two user studies that were performed to compare the experience with Scalable Fabric to that of the Microsoft Windows XP TaskBar.\n",

      "As we face an increasingly heterogeneous collection of computational devices, there is a need to develop a general approach to what it is that we design as we create computational things. One such basic approach is to consider computational technology to be a design material. In the present paper, we describe how a traditional material --- textiles --- can be used to investigate aspects of the expressiveness and aesthetics of computational technology as design material. As an example of this approach, we use an experimental design project made for an art museum. We describe a series of conceptual sketches of how textile artefacts can be used to re-interpret elementary acts of information technology use and the experiences from working with the final installation of one of them. Finally, we discuss properties of textiles and computational technology, such as expressions related to vagueness, unpredictability and slowness.\n",

The goal is to combine established textile craft routines with electronic functionalities while avoiding being limited to either crafting or engineering qualities. A discipline's toolset is decisive in what material can be handled and what output can be produced as well as the skills needed to handle it. New tools presented here allow for new interactions with materials and make new routines accessible to the processes of electronic making and textile crafting, potentially being inclusive to new user groups in the respective fields. Here, traditional needlecraft tools are adapted to integrate electric engineering needs. Functionally, these tools augment processes of textile crafting with information about electric properties of the artifact in production. More broadly, they are a chance to reflect on the roles and cultural assumptions of the technologies, and indeed crafts, that these tools enable.\n",

We explore the idea of viewing such information through the fabric of a pocket using low resolution bright LED matrix displays. A survey confirms viewing information on inaccessible phones is desirable, and establishes types of pockets in garments worn by respondents and what objects are typically put in pockets. A technical evaluation validates that LED light can shine through many common garment fabrics. Based on these results, functional hardware prototypes are constructed to demonstrate different form factors of through-fabric display devices, such as a phone, wallet, a key fob, a pen, and earbud headphone case. A simple interaction vocabulary for viewing key information on these devices is described, and the social and technical aspects of the approach are discussed. \n",

      "We present an inverse design tool for fabric formwork - a process where flat panels are sewn together to form a fabric container for casting a plaster sculpture. Compared to 3D printing techniques, the benefit of fabric formwork is its properties of low-cost and easy transport. The process of fabric formwork is akin to molding and casting but having a soft boundary. Deformation of the fabric container is governed by force equilibrium between the pressure forces from liquid fill and tension in the stretched fabric. The final result of fabrication depends on the shapes of the flat panels, the fabrication orientation and the placement of external supports. Our computational framework generates optimized flat panels and fabrication orientation with reference to a target shape, and determines effective locations for external supports. We demonstrate the function of this design tool on a variety of models with different shapes and topology. Physical fabrication is also demonstrated to validate our approach.\n",

The contributions of this framing are twofold. Firstly, we offer a theoretical contribution to the literature on dynamic fabric.

      "The virtual world is currently limited in the graphic representation and visualization of material designs. The limitation is in part due to the limited range and the relative simplicity of spectral properties of the materials simulated in a virtual environment. Our work starts with a fast classification and retrieval for handling the large numbers of multi-scale texture samples of complex deformable materials, such as, woven and knitted fabrics. We have developed a general system that can also serve as a unified platform for other material analysis and classification and a 3D panel design system for 3D clothing modeling and draping. Multi-scale color theme indexing for image acquisition and retrieval can be more intuitively supported by a multi-touch gesture interface that is now the preferred mode of interacting with tablets, screens, and other visual communication devices. These also add to the collaborative modes of input and retrieval in fabric and fashion design for virtual agents. In this paper we describe the process of texture analysis of real fabric materials and preliminary models for the 3D texture generation for virtual clothing, color theme design, and ultimately 3D draping based on robust collision detection methods.\n",

By controlling the movement of the print header, the FDM alternately weaves the stringing fibers across a row of pillars. Owing to the structure of the fibers, which supports and strengthens the pillars from each side, a 3D printer can print a thin sheet of fabric in an upright position while the fibers are being woven. In addition, this technique enables users to employ materials with various colors and/or properties when designing a pattern, and to prototype an interactive object using a variety of off-the-shelf materials such as a conductive filament. We also describe a technique for weaving textiles and introduce a list of parameters that enable users to design their own textile variations. Finally, we demonstrate examples showing the feasibility of our approach as well as numerous applications integrating printed textiles in a custom object design.\n",

      " The textile sector is one of the vital driving forces in the economy of south Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, etc. However, most of the textile industries suffer from frequent machinery faults everyday which reduces their productivity, which in terms reduces their profit. Existing systems for detecting the faults in textile machinery fails to find a remedy to this problem due to several limitations. Among them, sound based and vibration based fault detection systems are based on prototype machinery and has smaller data set to detect machinery fault properly. The fabric defect based, machine learning based approaches only detect machinery fault after fabric has become already defected. To remedy these limitations, in this paper, we propose a sound based fault detection system consisting of trained machine learning model from large data set that can detect machinery fault in textile industry. We use a sound sensor to measure the sound signal of the machine. We artificially create three real faults in the experimented machine and measure the sound signal during the faults. Next, we conduct Fast Fourier Analysis derive sound frequency and statistical analysis to derive different statistical features from the prepared data set. From these two analysis, we determine if the sound frequency and amplitude changes during the fault. After that, we feed the data set to ten machine learning algorithms. Finally, we evaluate our trained machine leaning models through ten fold cross validation to determine the precision, recall, and F1 score. We find the highest F1 of 57.7% in Nearest Centroid Algorithm. \n",

      "Printing-on-fabric is an affordable and practical method for creating self-actuated deployable surfaces: thin strips of plastic are deposited on top of a pre-stretched piece of fabric using a commodity 3D printer; the structure, once released, morphs to a programmed 3D shape. Several physics-aware modeling tools have recently been proposed to help designing such surfaces. However, existing simulators do not capture well all the deformations these structures can exhibit. In this work, we propose a new model for simulating printed-on-fabric composites based on a tailored bilayer formulation for modeling plastic-on-top-of-fabric strips, and an extended Saint-Venant–Kirchhoff material law for modeling the surrounding stretchy fabric. We show how to calibrate our model through a series of standard experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our simulator by conducting various tests.\n",

      "Stitched methods of e-textile fabrication offer durability and flexibility benefits, as well as relatively un-constrained layout patterns. The ability to affix discrete component packages without a PCB substrate would improve the overall flexibility and comfort of an e-textile garment. However, that level of integration between electronic and apparel manufacturing processes is difficult to achieve. Here we present the development of a stitched method of fabricating e-textile circuits with surface-mount components. The technique leverages technologies and methods common to sewn product manufacturing. Using a simulated high-intensity wear test, we evaluate the durability of this method for circuit architecture variables of component size, trace width, and trace orientation, as well as for methodological variables of solder deposition technique and reflow process. We show durability of 3% failure after a 14-hour wear test for the best manufacturing conditions. Further, we implement the manufacturing technique in an LED matrix display application.\n",

Due to the wearability concerns, low-power techniques are critical for e-textile applications. In this paper, we address the issue of the energy-aware routing for e-textile platforms and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. The platform we consider consists of dedicated components for e-textiles, including computational modules, dedicated transmission lines and thin-film batteries on fiber substrates. Furthermore, we derive an analytical upper bound for the achievable number of jobs completed over all possible routing strategies. From a practical standpoint, for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher, the routing technique we propose achieves about fifty percent of this analytical upper bound. Moreover, compared to the non-energy-aware counterpart, our routing technique increases the number of encryption jobs completed by one order of magnitude.\n",

      "A common method of generating a garment pattern is by draping fabric on a 3D form. Many apparel designers prefer this tangible process rather than the more abstract process of drafting patterns in 2D using CAD software, but the visualization benefits of 3D rendering remain important to product development. Currently, draped patterns must be manually digitized to transfer the shape to the CAD environment, a cumbersome process. Here, we explore augmenting the fabric used to drape patterns with e-textile components, such that pinning the fabric to the form directly digitizes the pattern shape. The e-textile interface uses a keypad matrix approach with rows and columns on opposite sides of the fabric. Passing a metallic pin through a row/column intersection creates a circuit connection that a microcontroller reads and maps to a 2D spatial layout on the screen. The proof-of-concept device developed here is a first step toward an automatic digitizing system that allows designers to preserve manual skills and processes while integrating more efficiently with digital systems.\n",

Previous studies have shown that wearable electromyography (EMG) sensors on limb muscles can be used to monitor the level of muscle fatigue continuously. However, there are two main problems in using these sensors for sports. One is that users wearing them create motion artifacts that affect the sensor data. The other is that the sensors disturb limb motion. To address these problems, we propose a method for estimating biceps fatigue with an e-textile headband. There is a strong correlation between frowning and jaw clenching muscle activity and the physical efforts made when exercising. Our method uses both of EMG signals of the temporal muscles and motion artifacts. The former indicate jaw clenching and the latter indicate frowning. Experimental results show that the root mean square values calculated from the headband sensor values significantly increased when biceps were fatigued.\n",

Currently, e-textile development relies on tools intended for traditional embedded systems, which utilize printed circuit boards and insulated wires. These tools do not translate well to e-textiles, which utilize fabric and uninsulated conductive thread. This mismatch of tools and materials can lead to an overly complicated development process for novices. In particular, rapid prototyping tools for traditional embedded systems are poorly matched for e-textile prototyping. This paper presents the ThreadBoard, a tool that supports rapid prototyping of e-textile circuits. With rapid prototyping, students can test circuit designs and identify circuitry errors prior to their sewn project. We present the design process used to iteratively create the ThreadBoard’s layout, with the goal of improving its usability for e-textile creators.\n",

Bending and folding can be used to detect human joint angles directly, or to detect possible errors in the signals of other joint-movement sensors due to fabric folding. Detection is achieved through measuring changes in the resistance of a complex stitch, formed by an industrial coverstitch machine using an un-insulated conductive yarn, on the surface of the fabric. We evaluate self-intersecting folds which cause short-circuits in the sensor, creating a quasi-binary resistance response, and non-contact bends, which deform the stitch structure and result in a more linear response. Folds and bends created by human movement were measured on the dorsal and lateral knee of both a robotic mannequin and a human. Preliminary results are promising. Both dorsal and lateral stitches showed repeatable characteristics during testing on a mechanical mannequin and a human.\n",

      "We present a new type of 3D printer that can form precise, but soft and deformable 3D objects from layers of off-the-shelf fabric. Our printer employs an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive. Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.\n",

However, innovating smart textile interfaces for numerous input and output modalities usually requires expert-level knowledge of specific materials, fabrication, and protocols. This paper presents EmTex, a construction kit based on embroidered textiles, patterned with dedicated sensing, actuating, and connecting components to facilitate the design and prototyping of smart textile interfaces. With machine embroidery, EmTex is compatible with a wide range of threads and underlay fabrics, proficient in various stitches to control the electric parameters, and capable of integrating versatile and reliable interaction functionalities with aesthetic patterns and precise designs. EmTex consists of 28 textile-based sensors, actuators, connectors, and displays, presented with standardized visual and tactile effects. Along with a visual programming tool, EmTex enables the prototyping of everyday textile interfaces for diverse life-living scenarios, that embody their touch input, and visual and haptic output properties. With EmTex, we conducted a workshop and invited 25 designers and makers to create freeform textile interfaces. Our findings revealed that EmTex helped the participants explore novel interaction opportunities with various smart textile prototypes. We also identified challenges EmTex shall face for practical use in promoting the design innovation of smart textiles.\n",

      "Sensing in e-textiles has generated great interest in a wide range of applications, including wetness detection. A common application for wetness detection sensors is the detection of urine in absorbent products such as diapers. However, unlike water, salinized liquids like urine accelerate the process of chemical reaction of integrated conductors (especially when exposed to electrical current), limiting the lifespan of e-textile sensors. This paper explores an approach to extending the lifespan of conductive thread sensors by blending copper filament with silver threads, and a comparative bench test of the effect of adding copper on the functional lifespan of a wetness sensor when exposed to saline. We find that while the bi-metallic sensor is effective in lengthening the lifespan of the conductive traces, it is likely due to the increased metal content rather than selective reaction of one metal to preserve the other. We make suggestions for further optimizing sensors.\n",

      "The influence of the textile substrate on the performance of a textile-based strain sensor has not been well understood or characterized in many wearable sensor evaluations. The underlying textile has its own anisotropic mechanical behaviors due to its woven or knit fabrication process, and introduces non-trivial structural influences on integrated wearable strain sensors. This study considers stitched strain sensors of two stitch geometries, fabricated on two different knit fabrics, with the sensor stitched in different orientations with respect to the knit structure. The resulting mechanical and electrical performance is characterized under cyclic extension, as the angle of extension (relative to the fabric) is also incrementally changed. The results illustrate a shift from linear to non-linear mechanical behavior as fabric stiffness increases, and variations in behavior between stitch geometries. Results show that force direction and sensor placement both introduce variability in calculated elastic modulus, which affect sensor modeling (e.g. predicting applied force from sensor response). A novel stitch geometry (the chainstitch sensor) is characterized as having a higher gauge force and lower transverse sensitivity factor than the coverstitch sensor. This work offers insight into the textile-sensor interface and design implications for development of textile-based sensors.\n",

      "Fabric sensors have been introduced to enable flexible touch-based interaction. We advance the technical capabilities of a scalable and low-profile knitted capacitive touch sensing system by introducing methods to improve its touch localization accuracy. The sensor hardware design tends toward minimalism by using a single conductive yarn and two external connections located at each endpoint. Fewer connectors simplify the textile system integration, but this comes at the expense of reduced signal information output from the system. The electrical continuity of the sensing element, essential to the process of knitting, also increases the uncertainty of localizing touch. We propose using Bode analysis to measure changes in signal due to capacitive touch, as well as design a new algorithm, MSD, which retains the most significant aspects of the signal in terms of touch location identification. We do not classify location of touch, but focus on an invariant signal representation. To evaluate our methods, we introduce ELD, a distance metric to compute the similarity of pairs of key-presses, generalizable to computing distances of tensors of varying lengths. Our experiments show that the proposed sensing method results in high-fidelity signals. Furthermore, the sparse representation of key-presses produced by MSD significantly increases separability between different touch locations. Possible applications based on these sensors are also illustrated through prototypes and use case descriptions.\n",

The sensors' performance is evaluated using a tensile tester while monitoring their electrical resistance before and after washing. The findings show that a single layer of bonding is the ideal construction and that after three wash cycles the sensor remains reliable.\n",

In particular, icons easily communicate information visually in a compact fashion, but it is unclear how to adapt them to the haptics-centric textile interface experience. Therefore, we investigated the recognizability of 84 haptic icons on fabrics. Each combines a shape, height profile (raised, recessed, or flat), and affected area (filled or outline). Our participants clearly preferred raised icons, and identified them with the highest accuracy and at competitive speeds. We also provide insights into icons that look very different, but are hard to distinguish via touch alone.\n",

Finally, we integrate the haptic muscles into a data glove and a teleoperation system and perform several user tests. Our results show that most users could detect detect force changes as low as 3% of the working range of the haptic muscles.

While staining happens unintentionally (e.g., spilling coffee), destaining can be used as an intentional design tool that selectively degrades stains on textiles. We explore the design space using silver doped titanium dioxide (TiO2/Ag), stains and light as a set of design primitives for interactive systems. We then developed replicable and accessible fabrication and testing methods that enable HCI researchers and designers to upgrade various fabrics to self-destaining textiles. Next, we demonstrate a Self-deStaining textile interface with embedded Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and moisture sensors that activate cleaning. Lastly, we showcase how the textile can be used in everyday objects such as self-cleaning clothes, a patterning station for phone cases, and accessories that change patterns and colors based on the user’s experiences.\n",

      "In Human-Computer Interaction, body maps are a standard tool to understand an individual's bodily phenomenon. Body maps often use abstract drawings and text annotations on an outline of a body. However, little research has explored alternate ways we can collect similar data. In this pictorial, we present tactile body maps, which use an array of textured fabric circles attached to a felt-shaped body instead of a more traditional approach to drawing body maps. We first present an illustration of how researchers can use tactile body maps and show an example of the type of data collected in the method. We then tested the augmented body map method alongside drawing body maps and verbal-only body descriptions with eight participants to explore the benefits and disadvantages of each technique. Through the data, we present a set of considerations that a researcher can use to decide which way would be most appropriate for their soma design process.\n",

      " We propose Skinergy for self-powered on-skin input sensing, a step towards prolonged on-skin device usages. In contrast to prior on-skin gesture interaction sensors, Skinergy’s sensor operation does not require external power. Enabled by the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) phenomenon, the machine-embroidered silicone-textile composite sensor converts mechanical energy from the input interaction into electrical energy. Our proof-of-concept untethered sensing system measures the voltages of generated electrical signals which are then processed for a diverse set of sensing tasks: discrete touch detection, multi-contact detection, contact localization, and gesture recognition. Skinergy is fabricated with off-the-shelf materials. The aesthetic and functional designs can be easily customized and digitally fabricated. We characterize Skinergy and conduct a 10-participant user study to (1) evaluate its gesture recognition performance and (2) probe user perceptions and potential applications.  Skinergy achieves 92.8% accuracy for a 11-class gesture recognition task. Our findings reveal that human factors (e.g., individual differences in skin properties, and aesthetic preferences) are key considerations in designing self-powered on-skin sensors for human inputs.\n",

      "Smart textile sensors have attracted increasing interest in the domain of wearable computing for human motion monitoring. Previous studies have shown that textile sensor layout has a major impact on the effectiveness and performance of wearable prototypes. However, it is still a trick and time-consuming issue to determine textile sensor layout in a quantitative approach as it involves figuring out the number, placement, and even orientations of sensors, yet there is no streamlined digital platform or tool specifically addressing this issue. In this paper, we introduce LayTex, a digital tool capable of generating layout proposals for personalized scenarios, which aims at facilitating designers and researchers to construct prototypes efficiently. The preliminary evaluation with designers on smart garments for scoliosis indicates that LayTex has great potential to lower the barriers and simplify the process of textile prototype construction. \n",

      " Researchers support race, gender, and age diverse groups of people to create with maker electronics. These groups include older adults, who are often overlooked as not interested or capable of learning new technologies due to ageist stereotypes. One approach, often involving e-textiles, leverages crafting as a bridge to broaden participation in making. We investigated ways to broaden participation in maker electronics for older adults by remotely co-designing e-textile projects with 6 older adult crafters over the course of 5 workshop sessions for a total of 45 hours. We developed a deeper understanding of their practices, identifying a Planner-Improviser Spectrum for how they approached their craft, and created medium fidelity prototypes. Our design implications draw on our participants’ crafting experience and their experience in the workshop to highlight what e-textile toolkit designers can learn from skilled older adult crafters, such as selecting familiar materials, supporting aesthetic goals, and making electronics more attainable.\n",

      " Patina is seldom used as an interface, but offers rich metaphors for slow technology and unmaking. This work explores how everyday objects’ wear and tear might serve as an interface by leveraging patina’s ability to semiotically communicate objects’ physical memory. We focus on textile patina because of fabric’s ubiquity, proximity to the body, and creative affordances (e.g., mending, sewing). Through our prototype of Pull It Together, a pocket whose surface actuates to modulate threadbareness, we discuss how artificial patina might enable designers to help users process invisible tensions (e.g., stress, unspoken needs). We developed distressed swatches with tangible animations to understand the medium’s materiality, and conductive patches to help mend literal and emotional wear and tear. We propose applications of artificial patina that support dialogue around well-being, community solidarity, and creative practice, and present opportunities for translating everyday objects’ sensory perspectives into ambient interfaces for reflection and communication.\n",

Creative sessions with seven designers show that TEX(alive) supports the exploration of temporality in textile interfaces, opening up a design space for unforeseen future application scenarios and alive-like expressions in material-driven design.

      "Sensing edema or swelling in the body is a parameter of interest for many clinical and cosmetic applications of wearable technology. Edema creates heightened sensitivity to pressure points, making soft textile-based sensors particularly attractive. However, swelling induces slow, gradual changes in body circumferences, which can be difficult to sense accurately, especially with soft e-textile sensors. Anthropometric variability, sensor placement, and body movements further confound accuracy. Here, we explore the feasibility of accurately sensing ankle swelling through a comparative assessment of a set of sensors representing 3 soft sensing mechanisms in a linear-strain bench test under three frequency conditions. These sensors are then applied in a simulated swelling experiment to assess their performance relative to circumferential changes similar to those experienced in swelling. We find that two sensors (stitched and capacitive) demonstrate reliable performance that approximates or exceeds expert human measurement for swelling. Resistive polymer cord and capacitive sensors exhibited accurate response under medium- and high-frequency extensions.\n",

      "Texture and color are important factors of fabric appearance. A system that could intuitively manipulate and design fabric texture and color would be a very powerful tool. This article presents an interactive fabric appearance design system that modulates the texture patterns of input fabric example images and transfers the color patterns from other input images onto them. For this purpose, we propose a method to synthesize a natural texture image based on our findings from subjective experiments: (1) intensity and its deviation of two input images are significantly related to the realistic appearance of synthesized textures and (2) the spatial-frequency and edge intensity of two different input images significantly influence the natural appearance of synthesized texture perception. In our procedure, first, the texture pattern of an input fabric image is modulated in terms of undulation, thickness, and roughness. Next, we transfer the color pattern of an original color image onto the modulated texture pattern in the YIQ color space. To perform this color transfer, we use the IQ component of the color image. To reduce the unnatural appearance of the output color-transfer image, we remove the high-frequency components of the original color image. In addition, the Y component of the color-transfer image is obtained by adding the deviation of the texture pattern Y component to the texture pattern of the color image. These algorithms for reducing unnaturalness and synthesizing images were developed based on our findings from several subjective experiments on natural appearance. Finally, we implemented our algorithm on a smart device. Our system allows us to interactively design the texture and color of fabric by using images.\n",

A smart textile mat with 64 pressure sensors has been developed including software at the Department of Industrial Design, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The developed sensory mat is able to measure pressure distribution of a neonate inside an incubator, which is expected to provide information for comfort assessment. Experiments at Philips Research and Máxima Medical Centre in the Netherlands demonstrate that the pressure distribution is affected by multiple foam material configurations.\n",

      "The existing studies suggest the following methods for measuring sleep postures: installing cameras and record the sleep postures then analyze the postures or measuring the change of the posture by attaching the sensor to the user's body. However, the installation of high-cost devices such as a camera or direct attachment of sensors on the subject's body present issues relating to the cost and convenience. As a solution, this paper develops a recognition algorithm for analyzing sleep postures using a smart pad with embedded fabric type pressure sensors. This algorithm is applied using a fabric-made smart pad with multiple pressure sensors. The sensors detect the distribution of the body pressure on the pad during sleeping, and the collected body pressure distribution data determines the sleep postures of the users. Further, this smart fabric pad does not require any additional analytical devices. This pad allows the users to monitor own sleep postures continuously. With the analyzed sleep posture data, the user can recognize one's typical sleep postures. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, this paper conducts an experiment to validate using the sleep posture data defined as nine categories. As a result, the algorithm had an average of 91.4% accuracy rate.\n",

Due to its softness and elasticity, our sensor provides an appealing haptic experience. It enables continuous input with high precision due to its innate haptic feedback and can be manufactured ready-made on a regular two-bed weft knitting machine, without requiring further post-processing steps. For our multi-component knit, we add resistive yarn to the filler material, in order to achieve a highly sensitive and responsive pressure sensing textile. Sensor resistance drops by ~90% when actuated with moderate finger pressure of 2  N, making the sensor accessible also for straightforward readout electronics. We discuss related manufacturing parameters and their effect on shape and electrical characteristics and explore design opportunities to harness visual and tactile affordances. Finally, we demonstrate several application scenarios by implementing diverse spaceR variations, including analog rocker- and four-way directional buttons, and show the possibility of mode-switching by tracking temporal data.\n",

      "Clinical-grade wearable sleep monitoring is a challenging problem since it requires concurrently monitoring brain activity, eye movement, muscle activity, cardio-respiratory features, and gross body movements. This requires multiple sensors to be worn at different locations as well as uncomfortable adhesives and discrete electronic components to be placed on the head. As a result, existing wearables either compromise comfort or compromise accuracy in tracking sleep variables. We propose PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure all the signals required for precise sleep stage tracking and to extract advanced sleep markers such as spindles and K-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography (PSG) and show that it significantly outperforms two commercially-available sleep tracking wearables—Fitbit and Oura Ring.\n",

We conducted a 9-week exploratory study in which 22 toddlers and 5 teachers used BendableSound during free play activities inside their classroom. Our qualitative results indicate that BendableSound was successfully adopted and integrated in toddler classrooms and could positively impact cognitive, social, and physical development. These results offer implications for the design of deformable surfaces and for their integration in activities to support the early development of toddlers.\n",

To this end, we designed Emoband, a wrist-worn textile-based tactile display that can stroke or squeeze on wearers’ wrists through the moving fabrics. We conducted two studies on the participants’ valence and arousal ratings towards the stroking and squeezing feedback from Emoband, respectively. Results showed that the valence ratings were significantly affected by the stroking or squeezing parameters and the wristband’s material, interactively. The movement-related parameters dominated the arousal rating. Meanwhile, the valence ratings demonstrated different tendencies between the two tactile feedback, with the valence increasing and decreasing along with the strength of stroking and squeezing, respectively. Besides, the valence ratings of the stroking stimuli demonstrated varied distributions across different materials, indicating the materials’ varying affective expressiveness in the wrist-worn haptic devices.\n",

However, the tools that e-textile creators use have been adapted from traditional textile or hardware tools.

This paper introduces the first iteration of a wearable e-textile debugging tool to assist novice engineers in problem solving e-textile circuitry errors. These errors are often only detected after the project is fully built and are resolved only by disassembling the circuit. Our tool actively monitors the continuity of the conductive thread as the user stitches, which enables the user to identify and correct circuitry errors as they create their project.\n",

Based on the recognition of such touching patterns as stroking, patting, and hugging, we conducted a verification of the estimation of the user's emotions using extracted features, such as strength and duration. The results indicate that emotional arousal was reflected by the number and strength of the touches, while the emotional valence emerged through the factor related to the context of the interaction.

In soft robotics and advanced materials science research, actuated fibers are gaining interest as thin, flexible materials that can morph in response to external stimuli. In this paper, we build on fluidic artificial muscles research to develop OmniFiber - a soft, line-based material system for designing movement-based interactions. We devised actuated thin (øouter < 1.8 mm) fluidic fibers with integrated soft sensors that exhibit perceivably strong forces, up to 19 N at 0.5 MPa, and a high speed of linear actuation peaking at 150mm/s. These allow to flexibly weave them into everyday tangible interactions; including on-body haptic devices for embodied learning, synchronized tangible interfaces for remote communication, and robotic crafting for expressivity. The design of such interactive capabilities is supported by OmniFiber’s design space, accessible fabrication pipeline, and a fluidic I/O control system to bring omni-functional fluidic fibers to the HCI toolbox of interactive morphing materials.\n",

This research designed six fabric structures: plain weave fabric, twill weave fabric, satin weave fabric, square plain fabric, twill variation fabric, and satin variation fabric. Referring to the national standard, the tensile fracture, burst performance and thickness tests of the fabric have been completed. The experimental results show that among the three primary weaves of plain weave, twill weave and satin weave, the satin weave fabric has the strongest tensile breaking and bursting performance; the thickness test result is that the plain weave fabric is the thinnest one. Among the changed weaves, the satin changed weave fabric has the strongest tensile breaking and bursting performance. The thickness test result shows that the thinnest flat is square plain fabric. In future work, we will continue to test the tearability and other mechanical properties and degradability of the fabric. Currently, polylactic acid fiber is mainly used in the medical field.

The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors.

This submission includes design and technical details, as well as initial interaction design scenarios. The next steps of this project will explore how these toys could support the development of empathy in toddlers through embodied play. Further work is needed in order to develop background research, collaborations with early childhood researchers, as well as empirical studies. Future work will include the development of these studies; iterating aspects of interaction and play through participatory design; and improving technical design to focus on reliability, robustness, and durability.\n",

      "In this study, we propose Laugh Log, an e-textile bellyband interface for laugh detection. Laugh Log measures pressure on the abdomen and detects laughter based on pressure changes. In this paper, we developed a corset type Laugh Log prototype system that measures abdominal pressure unobtrusively. We conducted a pilot experiment to investigate whether our proposed system could detect laughter based on pressure changes. During the experiment, subjects viewed some funny movies while wearing Laugh Log. We analyzed logged data and observed features of pressure change when subjects laughed. Although further experiments are required, the results suggest that it is possible to detect laughter using Laugh Log.\n",

      "This paper investigates the pinch angle as a menu selection technique for two-dimensional foldable textile controllers. Based on the principles of marking menus, the selection of a menu item is performed by grabbing a fold at a specific angle, while changing value is performed by rolling the fold between the fingers. In a first experiment we determined an upper bound for the number of different angles users can reliably grab into a piece of fabric on their forearm. Our results show that users can, without looking at it, reliably grab fabric on their forearm with an average accuracy between 30° and 45°, which would provide up to six different menu options selectable with the initial pinch. In a second experiment, we show that our textile sensor, Grabrics, can detect fold angles at 45° spacing with up to 85% accuracy. Our studies also found that user performance and workload are independent of the fabric types that were tested.\n",

      "Body posture is a good indicator of, amongst other things, people's state of arousal, focus of attention and level of interest in a conversation. Posture is conventionally measured by observation and hand coding of videos or, more recently, through automated computer vision and motion capture techniques. Here we introduce a novel alternative approach exploiting a new modality: posture classification using bespoke 'smart' trousers with integrated textile pressure sensors. Changes in posture translate to changes in pressure patterns across the surface of our clothing. We describe the construction of the textile pressure sensor and, using simple machine learning techniques on data gathered from 10 participants, demonstrate its ability to discriminate between 19 different basic posture types with high accuracy. This technology has the potential to support anonymous, unintrusive sensing of interest, attention and engagement in a wide variety of settings.\n",

Drawing from design studio culture and art therapy literature, we explore wearable computing as a creative and tangible medium (similar to markers, paints, clays, etc.) for motivating 'at-risk' children in hands-on making and expressive instantiation of ideas. Working with a local outreach organization for 'at-risk' middle school girls, we conducted five weekly workshops during which participants ideated, designed and implemented personal wearable computing projects. These sessions inspired participants (age 10-12) who tend to be uninterested and uncooperative in educational activities to complete interactive projects and engage with workshop volunteers as mentors and peers. We present the challenges, merits and outcomes of our approach, proposing wearable computing as a healing outlet and a mentoring strategy for at-risk children.\n",

The ability of this technology to subtly and ubiquitously change the color of the fabric itself has made us able to merge different fields and technologies with AmbikKraf. In addition, with an animated room divider screen, Ambikraf merged its technology with Japanese Byobu art to tighten the gap between traditional arts and contemporary technologies. Through few this AmbiKraf Byobu art installation and other installations we discuss the impact of this technology as a ubiquitous fabric display.

In the realm of personal architecture, bYOB is an interactive material that encourages users to explore and experiment by creating new objects to seamlessly integrate into their lives. The physical configuration of the object mediates its computational behavior. Therefore, an object built out of the system of modular elements understands its geometry and responds appropriately without any end-user programming. Our current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech. We describe how bYOB contributes to and differs from existing work in modular based systems and fabric interfaces.

      "Learning to use a construction kit to design, make, and program electronic textiles (e-textiles) has been found to be a rich context for students' learning of crafting, engineering and programming. We propose the development of what we call a 'deconstruction' kit---the design of faulty e-textile artifacts that students need to de- and reconstruct---as an alternative to gain insights into students' learning. We designed e-textile projects with strategically poor crafting, non-functional circuitry, and insufficient coding to investigate high school students' understanding of coding, circuit design and creation (through sewing) with the LilyPad Arduino. We videotaped and analyzed ten students collaborating in pairs as they engaged in debugging, or fixing, various problems in provided e-textile artifacts. Our findings indicate that these deconstruction kit projects are not only promising tools for evaluating students' understanding of e-textiles but can also become valuable learning tools on their own, especially when peer collaboration is taken into account.\n",

ZebraSense is based on an industrial multi-layer textile weaving technique, yet it enables a novel capacitive sensing paradigm, where each sensing element contributes to touch detection on both surfaces of the sensor simultaneously. Unlike the common \"sensor sandwich\" approach used in previous work, ZebraSense inherently minimizes the number of sensing elements, which drastically simplifies both sensor construction and its integration into soft goods, while preserving maximum sensor resolution. The experimental evaluation confirmed the validity of our approach and demonstrated that ZebraSense is a reliable, efficient, and accurate solution for detecting user gestures in various dual-sided interaction scenarios, allowing for new use cases in smart apparel, home decoration, toys, and other textile objects.\n",

Despite the great progress in embedded technology, artificial interfaces, such as remote controls and touch screens, remain the dominant media for interacting with smart everyday objects. Motivated by recent advancements in smart textile technologies, we investigate the usability and acceptance of fabric-based controllers in the smart home environment. In this article we describe the development and evaluation of three textile interfaces for controlling a motorized recliner armchair in a living room setting. The core of this contribution is the empirical study with twenty participants that contrasted the user experience of three textile-based interaction techniques to a standard remote control. Despite the slightly lower reliability of the textile interfaces, their overall acceptance was higher. The study shows that the hedonic quality and attractiveness of textile interfaces have higher impact on user acceptance compared to pragmatic qualities, such as efficiency, fluidity of interaction, and reliability. Attractiveness profits from the direct and nearly invisible integration of the interaction device into textile objects such as furniture.\n",

Unlike conventional wearable IMU MoCap based on inverse dynamics, MoCaPose decouples the sensor position from the pose system. MoCaPose uses a deep regressor to continuously predict the 3D upper body joints coordinates from 16-channel textile capacitive sensors, unbound by specific applications. The concept is implemented through two prototyping iterations to first solve the technical challenges, then establish the textile integration through fashion-technology co-design towards a design-centric smart garment. A 38-hour dataset of synchronized video and capacitive data from 21 participants was recorded for validation. The motion tracking result was validated on multiple levels from statistics (R2 ~ 0.91) and motion tracking metrics (MP JPE ~ 86mm) to the usability in pose and motion recognition (0.9 F1 for 10-class classification with unsupervised class discovery). The design guidelines impose few technical constraints, allowing the wearable system to be design-centric and usecase-specific. Overall, MoCaPose demonstrates that textile-based capacitive sensing with its unique advantages, can be a promising alternative for wearable motion tracking and other relevant wearable motion recognition applications.\n",

Masticatory muscle activity is relevant to several daily activities such as diet, sleep bruxism, and human motor control. Our aim is to leverage continuous EMG data of the masticatory muscles for monitoring daily activities. For motion artifact reduction, which is a major problem for measuring EMG with textile electrodes, we propose a new algorithm based on kinesiology by utilizing a correlation coefficient between the root mean square of the right side EMG and that of the left side EMG. We have developed a hitoeCap prototype and conducted experiments to verify the usability of the PEDOT-PSS electrodes and the feasibility of our proposed algorithm.\n",

      "We present RESi (Resistive tExtile Sensor Interfaces), a novel sensing approach enabling a new kind of yarn-based, resistive pressure sensing. The core of RESi builds on a newly designed yarn, which features conductive and resistive properties. We run a technical study to characterize the behaviour of the yarn and to determine the sensing principle. We demonstrate how the yarn can be used as a pressure sensor and discuss how specific issues, such as connecting the soft textile sensor with the rigid electronics can be solved. In addition, we present a platform-independent API that allows rapid prototyping. To show its versatility, we present applications developed with different textile manufacturing techniques, including hand sewing, machine sewing, and weaving. RESi is a novel technology, enabling textile pressure sensing to augment everyday objects with interactive capabilities.\n",

      "In this paper we propose a new technology of touch sensitive textile displays that can detect touch without adding additional sensors to a thermochromic inks and peltier semi-conductor display system. Without any changes to the hardware of the display, we present a method to modify the existing temperature controllers of pelter elements to detect impulse temperature transients that are caused through touch. Using this method, the textile display can become a touch sensitive interactive textile display. We present the results of this system and two application prototypes that enhance simple table cloths into ubiquitously becoming a tic-tac-toe gaming platform and an interactive drawing pad with touch sensing. In addition, our user evaluations to observe the robustness and the performance of the system indicate that the system is detects touch at acceptably high speeds. In addition, the system performance is independent of the ambient temperature and depends mainly on the temperature of the finger.\n",

      "In this paper we present a smart soccer shoe that uses textile pressure sensing matrices to detect and analyze the interaction between players' foot and the ball. We describe the sensor system that consists of two 3 × 4 and one 3 × 3 matrices sampled at over 500Hz with low power electronics that allows continuous operation (incl. wireless transmission) for 8 hours using a small 800mA/h Li-Po battery. We show how relevant parameters for shot analysis such as contact speed and contact angles can be reliably derived from the sensor signals. To ensure reliable ground truth we evaluated the system with a kick robot in the adidas testing facility, which is the standard approach used by adidas to systematically and quantitatively test new shoes and balls. The test encompasses 17 different types of shots and achieves a near 100% classification accuracy/F-score. The system endured extreme levels of impact resulting in over 100km/hr ball speed.\n",

      "Wearable technology projects sometimes present complex problems, which are hard to solve through computer science solutions alone. Our interdisciplinary team met such a problem in the form of near infrared sensor noise due to fabric interference.

This case study shows how incorporating everyone's expertise on an interdisciplinary team can afford solutions, which better accomplish the goals of a project than individual disciplines could alone.\n",

      "In-situ exploration of heart rate (HR) zones during cardio training (CT) is important for training efficiency. However, approaches for monitoring HR, either depend on complex visualizations on small screens (i.e., smartwatches) or intrusive modalities (i.e. haptic, auditory) that might force the attention to the information. We developed an early prototype, Howel, a novel wrist-worn soft wearable to display HR zone information during CT. Our concept utilizes mapping information onto dynamic patterns (color changing stripes) as an easy-to-understand ambient display. To preserve non-intrusiveness, it uses non-emissive modality by heating thermochromic paints on its textile surfaces. Early feedback from three participants suggests that soft wearables with non- emissive dynamic patterns have potential (1) to embed information organically on the body, (2) to give easy-to-understand in-situ intensity information and (3) to keep the attention on the exercise instead of performance measures.\n",

      "Interactive interiors which are customizable to the design preferences and functional purposes of individual users can help create flexible interiors within fixed spaces. They are particularly relevant to densely populated cities where most people live in compact spaces. This proposed research explores interactive interior textile surfaces as an adaptive media which can transform interiors via the change of colors, luminescence and surface design. This is done by investigating the integration of textile base material via embellishment techniques, such as embroidery and felting, with polymeric photonic fibers (POF) which enhance tactile quality without compromising on the technological functionality. Their flexible application methods mean that, it is adaptable to the rigid nature of polymeric photonic fibers. In addition, embroidery has the unique ability to arrange and combine threads together with various materials in non-rigid formations and multiple directions to create stable two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms [1]. Different materials can be combined to explore aesthetically pleasing surface designs, textures and achieve positive tactile quality.\n",

      "Cycling is an efficient and effective way to improve one's overall fitness level, such as cardiovascular fitness, stamina, lower body strength, and body fat percentage. To improve fitness performance, real-time cycling fitness tracking can not only allow cyclists to better control their energy outputs but also help push workout intensity and keep users accountable for their fitness progress. However, existing bike sensors (e.g., the ones mounted to bike's wheel hub or crank arm) are only limited to measuring cycling cadence and speed. Although several recent studies relying on on-body sensors or cameras can provide more fine-grained information (e.g., riding position and knee joint angle), they would either require inconvenient setups or raise serious privacy concerns. To circumvent these limitations, in this paper, we propose SmarCyPad, an innovative smart seat pad that can continuously and unobtrusively track five cycling-specific metrics, including cadence, per-leg stability, leg strength balance, riding position, and knee joint angle of the cyclist. Specifically, we embed conductive fabric sensors in the seat pad to sense the pressure applied to the bike's seat exerted by the cyclist's gluteal muscles. A series of signal processing algorithms are developed to estimate the pedaling period from the sensed pressure signal and further derive the cycling cadence, per-leg stability, and leg strength balance. Additionally, we leverage a deep learning model to detect the cyclist's riding position and reconstruct the cyclist's knee joint angles via linear regression. The sensors and the system prototype are manufactured from scratch leveraging off-the-shelf materials, and the total cost is less than $50. Extensive experiments involving 15 participants demonstrate that SmarCyPad can accurately estimate the cycling cadence with an average error of 1.13 rounds per minute, quantify the cycling stability for each leg, detect cycling imbalance, distinguish five riding positions with an accuracy of 96.60%, and continuously track the knee joint angle with an average mean error as low as 9.58 degrees.\n",

      "Electronic textile (e-textile) toolkits have been successful in broadening participation in STEAM-related activities, in expanding perceptions of computing, and in engaging users in creative, expressive, and meaningful digital-physical design. While a range of well-designed e-textile toolkits exist (e.g., LilyPad), they cater primarily to adults and older children and have a high barrier of entry for some users. We are investigating new approaches to support younger children (K-4) in the creative design, play, and customization of e-textiles and wearables without requiring the creation of code. This demo paper presents one such example of ongoing work: MakerShoe, an e-textile platform for designing shoe-based interactive wearable experiences. We discuss our two participatory design sessions as well as our initial prototype, which uses single-function magnetically attachable electronic modules to support circuit creation and the design of responsive, interactive behaviors.\n",

      " Within the emerging field of e-textiles, goldwork embroidery (also known as metalwork) which uses metal threads and materials is an underexplored area, despite being a centuries-old practice in traditional crafts of different cultures. In this paper, we explore the material culture of textile goldwork to better understand how e-textile researchers can leverage their material properties, palette, and practices. First, we provide a historical background of English goldwork to give HCI researchers context on this craft field including technological and cultural influences. Then, we interview 13 contemporary goldwork practitioners on their creative practice to better understand the tools, techniques, and skills they employ. Our study findings show how goldwork practitioners deal with the unique constraints of metal threads and materials, and how these materials need to be handled differently than regular non-metal threads and fibers. This paper contributes an analysis of goldwork practices for HCI audiences with suggestions on how we can leverage these practices for the future of e-textile hybrid crafts.\n",

    "    \"Interactive interiors which are customizable to the design preferences and functional purposes of individual users can help create flexible interiors within fixed spaces. They are particularly relevant to densely populated cities where most people live in compact spaces. This proposed research explores interactive interior textile surfaces as an adaptive media which can transform interiors via the change of colors, luminescence and surface design. This is done by investigating the integration of textile base material via embellishment techniques, such as embroidery and felting, with polymeric photonic fibers (POF) which enhance tactile quality without compromising on the technological functionality. Their flexible application methods mean that, it is adaptable to the rigid nature of polymeric photonic fibers. In addition, embroidery has the unique ability to arrange and combine threads together with various materials in non-rigid formations and multiple directions to create stable two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms [1]. Different materials can be combined to explore aesthetically pleasing surface designs, textures and achieve positive tactile quality.\",\n",
