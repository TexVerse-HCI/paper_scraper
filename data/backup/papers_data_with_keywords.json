Many people already use seat cushions to improve their posture during work or leisure. In this work, we present an E-Textile cushion. This seat cushion is equipped with capacitive proximity sensors that track the proximity and motion of the sitting user and distinguish up to 7 postures. Giving a user immediate feedback on the posture can facilitate more healthy behavior. We evaluated a number of different electrode setups, materials, and classification methods, leading to a maximum accuracy of 97.1%.",

In this paper, we present a set of wearable e-textile displays for running groups called Social Fabric Fitness (SFF). SFF provides a glanceable, shared screen on the back of the wearer's shirt to increase awareness and motivation of group fitness performance. We discuss parallel prototyping of three designs-one flexible e-ink and two flexible LED-based displays; the selection and refinement of one design; and two evaluations'a field study of 10 running groups and two case studies of running races. Our qualitative findings indicate that SFF improves awareness of individual and group performance, helps groups stay together, and improves in-situ motivation. We close with reflections for future athletic e-textile displays.",

A larger number of windows, however, may increase the time that users spend arranging and switching between tasks. We present Scalable Fabric, a task management system designed to address problems with the proliferation of open windows on the PC desktop. Scalable Fabric couples window management with a flexible visual representation to provide a focus-plus-context solution to desktop complexity. Users interact with windows in a central focus region of the display in a normal manner, but when a user moves a window into the periphery, it shrinks in size, getting smaller as it nears the edge of the display. The window \"minimize\" action is redefined to return the window to its preferred location in the periphery, allowing windows to remain visible when not in use. Windows in the periphery may be grouped together into named tasks, and task switching is accomplished with a single mouse click. The spatial arrangement of tasks leverages human spatial memory to make task switching easier. We review the evolution of Scalable Fabric over three design iterations, including discussion of results from two user studies that were performed to compare the experience with Scalable Fabric to that of the Microsoft Windows XP TaskBar.",

As an example of this approach, we use an experimental design project made for an art museum. We describe a series of conceptual sketches of how textile artefacts can be used to re-interpret elementary acts of information technology use and the experiences from working with the final installation of one of them.

New tools presented here allow for new interactions with materials and make new routines accessible to the processes of electronic making and textile crafting, potentially being inclusive to new user groups in the respective fields. Here, traditional needlecraft tools are adapted to integrate electric engineering needs. Functionally, these tools augment processes of textile crafting with information about electric properties of the artifact in production. More broadly, they are a chance to reflect on the roles and cultural assumptions of the technologies, and indeed crafts, that these tools enable.",

A survey confirms viewing information on inaccessible phones is desirable, and establishes types of pockets in garments worn by respondents and what objects are typically put in pockets. A technical evaluation validates that LED light can shine through many common garment fabrics. Based on these results, functional hardware prototypes are constructed to demonstrate different form factors of through-fabric display devices, such as a phone, wallet, a key fob, a pen, and earbud headphone case. A simple interaction vocabulary for viewing key information on these devices is described, and the social and technical aspects of the approach are discussed. ",

Compared to 3D printing techniques, the benefit of fabric formwork is its properties of low-cost and easy transport. The process of fabric formwork is akin to molding and casting but having a soft boundary. Deformation of the fabric container is governed by force equilibrium between the pressure forces from liquid fill and tension in the stretched fabric. The final result of fabrication depends on the shapes of the flat panels, the fabrication orientation and the placement of external supports. Our computational framework generates optimized flat panels and fabrication orientation with reference to a target shape, and determines effective locations for external supports. We demonstrate the function of this design tool on a variety of models with different shapes and topology. Physical fabrication is also demonstrated to validate our approach.",

Our work starts with a fast classification and retrieval for handling the large numbers of multi-scale texture samples of complex deformable materials, such as, woven and knitted fabrics. We have developed a general system that can also serve as a unified platform for other material analysis and classification and a 3D panel design system for 3D clothing modeling and draping. Multi-scale color theme indexing for image acquisition and retrieval can be more intuitively supported by a multi-touch gesture interface that is now the preferred mode of interacting with tablets, screens, and other visual communication devices. These also add to the collaborative modes of input and retrieval in fabric and fashion design for virtual agents. In this paper we describe the process of texture analysis of real fabric materials and preliminary models for the 3D texture generation for virtual clothing, color theme design, and ultimately 3D draping based on robust collision detection methods.",

In addition, this technique enables users to employ materials with various colors and/or properties when designing a pattern, and to prototype an interactive object using a variety of off-the-shelf materials such as a conductive filament. We also describe a technique for weaving textiles and introduce a list of parameters that enable users to design their own textile variations.

Using conductive and non-conductive resins, we printed out two types of sequins using a 3D printer1, which are then combined and embroidered using the traditional sequin embroidery technique. When a force such as a touch or press is applied to the conductive sequins, a signal generated from the circuit, which those sequins themselves are part of, will be sent to the computer.

Several physics-aware modeling tools have recently been proposed to help designing such surfaces. However, existing simulators do not capture well all the deformations these structures can exhibit. In this work, we propose a new model for simulating printed-on-fabric composites based on a tailored bilayer formulation for modeling plastic-on-top-of-fabric strips, and an extended Saint-Venant\u2013Kirchhoff material law for modeling the surrounding stretchy fabric. We show how to calibrate our model through a series of standard experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of our simulator by conducting various tests.",

The ability to affix discrete component packages without a PCB substrate would improve the overall flexibility and comfort of an e-textile garment. However, that level of integration between electronic and apparel manufacturing processes is difficult to achieve. Here we present the development of a stitched method of fabricating e-textile circuits with surface-mount components. The technique leverages technologies and methods common to sewn product manufacturing. Using a simulated high-intensity wear test, we evaluate the durability of this method for circuit architecture variables of component size, trace width, and trace orientation, as well as for methodological variables of solder deposition technique and reflow process. We show durability of 3% failure after a 14-hour wear test for the best manufacturing conditions. Further, we implement the manufacturing technique in an LED matrix display application.",

Due to the wearability concerns, low-power techniques are critical for e-textile applications. In this paper, we address the issue of the energy-aware routing for e-textile platforms and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it. The platform we consider consists of dedicated components for e-textiles, including computational modules, dedicated transmission lines and thin-film batteries on fiber substrates. Furthermore, we derive an analytical upper bound for the achievable number of jobs completed over all possible routing strategies. From a practical standpoint, for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher, the routing technique we propose achieves about fifty percent of this analytical upper bound. Moreover, compared to the non-energy-aware counterpart, our routing technique increases the number of encryption jobs completed by one order of magnitude.",

To do this, we present the first smart fabric design that harnesses the ferromagnetic properties of conductive thread. Specifically, we manipulate the polarity of magnetized fabric and encode different forms of data including 2D images and bit strings. These bits can be read by swiping a commodity smartphone across the fabric, using its inbuilt magnetometer. Our results show that magnetized fabric retains its data even after washing, drying and ironing. Using a glove made of magnetized fabric, we can also perform six gestures in front of a smartphone, with a classification accuracy of 90.1%. Finally, using magnetized thread, we create fashion accessories like necklaces, ties, wristbands and belts with data storage capabilities as well as enable authentication applications.",

Many apparel designers prefer this tangible process rather than the more abstract process of drafting patterns in 2D using CAD software, but the visualization benefits of 3D rendering remain important to product development. Currently, draped patterns must be manually digitized to transfer the shape to the CAD environment, a cumbersome process. Here, we explore augmenting the fabric used to drape patterns with e-textile components, such that pinning the fabric to the form directly digitizes the pattern shape. The e-textile interface uses a keypad matrix approach with rows and columns on opposite sides of the fabric. Passing a metallic pin through a row/column intersection creates a circuit connection that a microcontroller reads and maps to a 2D spatial layout on the screen. The proof-of-concept device developed here is a first step toward an automatic digitizing system that allows designers to preserve manual skills and processes while integrating more efficiently with digital systems.",

Previous studies have shown that wearable electromyography (EMG) sensors on limb muscles can be used to monitor the level of muscle fatigue continuously. However, there are two main problems in using these sensors for sports. One is that users wearing them create motion artifacts that affect the sensor data. The other is that the sensors disturb limb motion. To address these problems, we propose a method for estimating biceps fatigue with an e-textile headband. There is a strong correlation between frowning and jaw clenching muscle activity and the physical efforts made when exercising. Our method uses both of EMG signals of the temporal muscles and motion artifacts. The former indicate jaw clenching and the latter indicate frowning. Experimental results show that the root mean square values calculated from the headband sensor values significantly increased when biceps were fatigued.",

Currently, e-textile development relies on tools intended for traditional embedded systems, which utilize printed circuit boards and insulated wires. These tools do not translate well to e-textiles, which utilize fabric and uninsulated conductive thread. This mismatch of tools and materials can lead to an overly complicated development process for novices. In particular, rapid prototyping tools for traditional embedded systems are poorly matched for e-textile prototyping. This paper presents the ThreadBoard, a tool that supports rapid prototyping of e-textile circuits. With rapid prototyping, students can test circuit designs and identify circuitry errors prior to their sewn project. We present the design process used to iteratively create the ThreadBoard\u2019s layout, with the goal of improving its usability for e-textile creators.",

Detection is achieved through measuring changes in the resistance of a complex stitch, formed by an industrial coverstitch machine using an un-insulated conductive yarn, on the surface of the fabric. We evaluate self-intersecting folds which cause short-circuits in the sensor, creating a quasi-binary resistance response, and non-contact bends, which deform the stitch structure and result in a more linear response. Folds and bends created by human movement were measured on the dorsal and lateral knee of both a robotic mannequin and a human. Preliminary results are promising.

The substantial growth in the field of functional apparel design, such as the use of smart textiles, encourages researchers and fashion designers to incorporate technology within their designs. In much previous work, e-textiles have required interdisciplinary knowledge such as electrical engineering and computer science to be successful. To help with this we created ready-to-use shape changing fabric samples for fashion designers. We explored this research gap through a preliminary user case study with seven experienced designers. Our results suggest design approaches for shape changing fabric samples that would assist non-technically skilled designers incorporating technology in their designs.",

First, we created a collection of functional and non-functional textile samples. Their development was based on three aspects: design, fabrication, and sensing. The design aspect covered different visual (shape, color) and haptic (details, textures) designs, fabrication explored three textile-specific fabrication methods, and electronic sensing offered options for adding touch-sensing capabilities. Second, we reflected on created samples and their characteristics contrasting different designs and speculating on why some work better than others. Our main findings and insights are presented in five clusters: ergonomics, visual affordances, perception of textures, the direction of movement, and the economic usage of design elements. This intermediate-level knowledge can provide a starting point for each professional or novice designer to take inspiration from, when creating their own textile user interfaces.",

Our printer employs an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive. Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.",

This paper presents EmTex, a construction kit based on embroidered textiles, patterned with dedicated sensing, actuating, and connecting components to facilitate the design and prototyping of smart textile interfaces. With machine embroidery, EmTex is compatible with a wide range of threads and underlay fabrics, proficient in various stitches to control the electric parameters, and capable of integrating versatile and reliable interaction functionalities with aesthetic patterns and precise designs. EmTex consists of 28 textile-based sensors, actuators, connectors, and displays, presented with standardized visual and tactile effects. Along with a visual programming tool, EmTex enables the prototyping of everyday textile interfaces for diverse life-living scenarios, that embody their touch input, and visual and haptic output properties. With EmTex, we conducted a workshop and invited 25 designers and makers to create freeform textile interfaces. Our findings revealed that EmTex helped the participants explore novel interaction opportunities with various smart textile prototypes. We also identified challenges EmTex shall face for practical use in promoting the design innovation of smart textiles.",

A common application for wetness detection sensors is the detection of urine in absorbent products such as diapers. However, unlike water, salinized liquids like urine accelerate the process of chemical reaction of integrated conductors (especially when exposed to electrical current), limiting the lifespan of e-textile sensors. This paper explores an approach to extending the lifespan of conductive thread sensors by blending copper filament with silver threads, and a comparative bench test of the effect of adding copper on the functional lifespan of a wetness sensor when exposed to saline. We find that while the bi-metallic sensor is effective in lengthening the lifespan of the conductive traces, it is likely due to the increased metal content rather than selective reaction of one metal to preserve the other. We make suggestions for further optimizing sensors.",

The underlying textile has its own anisotropic mechanical behaviors due to its woven or knit fabrication process, and introduces non-trivial structural influences on integrated wearable strain sensors. This study considers stitched strain sensors of two stitch geometries, fabricated on two different knit fabrics, with the sensor stitched in different orientations with respect to the knit structure. The resulting mechanical and electrical performance is characterized under cyclic extension, as the angle of extension (relative to the fabric) is also incrementally changed. The results illustrate a shift from linear to non-linear mechanical behavior as fabric stiffness increases, and variations in behavior between stitch geometries. Results show that force direction and sensor placement both introduce variability in calculated elastic modulus, which affect sensor modeling (e.g. predicting applied force from sensor response). A novel stitch geometry (the chainstitch sensor) is characterized as having a higher gauge force and lower transverse sensitivity factor than the coverstitch sensor.

The results show that the average diameter of the silver particles in the conductive layer of the fabric electrode is about 15 \u03bc m, the thickness is about 100 \u03bc m, and the conductivity of the conductive layer is 8.658 \u00d7 105 S/m. The trend of the AC impedance of the fabric electrode is similar to that of the standard Ag-AgCl electrode, and the impedance of the plain weave fabric electrode is lower than the standard gel Ag-AgCl electrode at 10~45 Hz; the collected ECG signal is similar to the R wave amplitude measured by the standard Ag-AgCl electrode, and the ECG signal has a clear spectral composition, which verifies the feasibility of the fabric electrode to collect ECG signal.",

We advance the technical capabilities of a scalable and low-profile knitted capacitive touch sensing system by introducing methods to improve its touch localization accuracy. The sensor hardware design tends toward minimalism by using a single conductive yarn and two external connections located at each endpoint. Fewer connectors simplify the textile system integration, but this comes at the expense of reduced signal information output from the system. The electrical continuity of the sensing element, essential to the process of knitting, also increases the uncertainty of localizing touch. We propose using Bode analysis to measure changes in signal due to capacitive touch, as well as design a new algorithm, MSD, which retains the most significant aspects of the signal in terms of touch location identification. We do not classify location of touch, but focus on an invariant signal representation. To evaluate our methods, we introduce ELD, a distance metric to compute the similarity of pairs of key-presses, generalizable to computing distances of tensors of varying lengths. Our experiments show that the proposed sensing method results in high-fidelity signals. Furthermore, the sparse representation of key-presses produced by MSD significantly increases separability between different touch locations. Possible applications based on these sensors are also illustrated through prototypes and use case descriptions.",

The sensors' performance is evaluated using a tensile tester while monitoring their electrical resistance before and after washing. The findings show that a single layer of bonding is the ideal construction and that after three wash cycles the sensor remains reliable.",

Therefore, we investigated the recognizability of 84 haptic icons on fabrics. Each combines a shape, height profile (raised, recessed, or flat), and affected area (filled or outline).

The proposed device, called a \u2018haptic muscle\u2019, is a soft pneumatic actuator constructed from a fabric-silicone composite in a toroidal structure. We explore the requirements of the ideal haptic feedback mechanism, construct several haptic muscles using different materials, and experimentally determine their dynamic pressure response as well as sensitivity (their ability to communicate small changes in haptic feedback). Finally, we integrate the haptic muscles into a data glove and a teleoperation system and perform several user tests. Our results show that most users could detect detect force changes as low as 3% of the working range of the haptic muscles. We also find that the haptic feedback causes users to apply up to 52% less force on an object while handling soft and fragile objects with a teleoperation system. ",

To support rapid fabrication in a sketching-like fashion, we developed a handheld dispenser tool for directly applying continuous functional tapes of desired length as well as discrete patches. We introduce versatile compositions techniques that allow for creating complex circuits, utilizing commodity textile accessories and sketching custom-shaped I/O modules.

Reflecting on outputs from an e-textile design workshop and 8-week design projects with four textile design students using an e-textile toolkit, and follow-up data collection with the students one year after the projects, we argue that starting technical explorations with raw materials results in a better understanding and more flexible use of technical knowledge. We also argue that this newly acquired knowledge is then more fully integrated with their pre-existing material knowledge as it is applied to physical interface design.

These have been further explored with experts from the field during interviews, and finally tested in a user study. As a conclusion of the study, we define five design recommendations for textile interfaces and present several prototypes that demonstrate them in practice.

However, interesting questions remain about what type of natural gestures people make when interacting with textile interfaces and their emotional response to this interaction. We introduce GesFabri, a set of five interactive textile interfaces with distinct textures, created to investigate the intuitive interaction gestures and accompanied the emotional experience. This research sought to (1) design textile interfaces with intuitive gesture affordance, (2) explore the emotional effects of the developed gesture-based interfaces under four feedback modes (touch-only, visual feedback, audio feedback, multisensory feedback). The experimental results verify our hypotheses that (1) textile texture could provide natural gesture affordances; (2) the GesFabri interfaces' feedback mode was the main factor in the differences of emotional valence, arousal, GSR; and (3) both gesture-based interaction on textiles and the feedback mode had an impact on user emotions. These results highlight the gesture affordances of the e-textile interfaces and contribute to a better understanding of the user experience when interacting with gesture-based textile interfaces.",

Enabled by the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) phenomenon, the machine-embroidered silicone-textile composite sensor converts mechanical energy from the input interaction into electrical energy. Our proof-of-concept untethered sensing system measures the voltages of generated electrical signals which are then processed for a diverse set of sensing tasks: discrete touch detection, multi-contact detection, contact localization, and gesture recognition. Skinergy is fabricated with off-the-shelf materials. The aesthetic and functional designs can be easily customized and digitally fabricated. We characterize Skinergy and conduct a 10-participant user study to (1) evaluate its gesture recognition performance and (2) probe user perceptions and potential applications. \u00a0Skinergy achieves 92.8% accuracy for a 11-class gesture recognition task. Our findings reveal that human factors (e.g., individual differences in skin properties, and aesthetic preferences) are key considerations in designing self-powered on-skin sensors for human inputs.",

Previous studies have shown that textile sensor layout has a major impact on the effectiveness and performance of wearable prototypes. However, it is still a trick and time-consuming issue to determine textile sensor layout in a quantitative approach as it involves figuring out the number, placement, and even orientations of sensors, yet there is no streamlined digital platform or tool specifically addressing this issue. In this paper, we introduce LayTex, a digital tool capable of generating layout proposals for personalized scenarios, which aims at facilitating designers and researchers to construct prototypes efficiently. The preliminary evaluation with designers on smart garments for scoliosis indicates that LayTex has great potential to lower the barriers and simplify the process of textile prototype construction.

Anthropometric variability, sensor placement, and body movements further confound accuracy. Here, we explore the feasibility of accurately sensing ankle swelling through a comparative assessment of a set of sensors representing 3 soft sensing mechanisms in a linear-strain bench test under three frequency conditions. These sensors are then applied in a simulated swelling experiment to assess their performance relative to circumferential changes similar to those experienced in swelling.

This article presents an interactive fabric appearance design system that modulates the texture patterns of input fabric example images and transfers the color patterns from other input images onto them. For this purpose, we propose a method to synthesize a natural texture image based on our findings from subjective experiments: (1) intensity and its deviation of two input images are significantly related to the realistic appearance of synthesized textures and (2) the spatial-frequency and edge intensity of two different input images significantly influence the natural appearance of synthesized texture perception. In our procedure, first, the texture pattern of an input fabric image is modulated in terms of undulation, thickness, and roughness. Next, we transfer the color pattern of an original color image onto the modulated texture pattern in the YIQ color space. To perform this color transfer, we use the IQ component of the color image. To reduce the unnatural appearance of the output color-transfer image, we remove the high-frequency components of the original color image. In addition, the Y component of the color-transfer image is obtained by adding the deviation of the texture pattern Y component to the texture pattern of the color image. These algorithms for reducing unnaturalness and synthesizing images were developed based on our findings from several subjective experiments on natural appearance. Finally, we implemented our algorithm on a smart device. Our system allows us to interactively design the texture and color of fabric by using images.",

We developed our prototype by integrating four distinct types of sensing methods, namely: inductive sensing, capacitive sensing, resistive sensing, and NFC in a multi-layer fabric structure into the form factor of a jeans pocket. Through a ten-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our prototype across 11 common objects including hands, 8 force gestures, and 30 NFC tag placements.

In this paper we focus on the pattern-sharing artifact of stitch samplers, which are used for sharing, teaching, and learning stitching techniques, and explore how the design decisions around them should be adapted for practicing e-textile exercises. To do so, we conducted three studies: (1) preliminary interviews with five modern stitch sampler designers to understand what stitch samplers are used for, (2) a think-aloud user study of our initial e-textile sampler with ten beginners, and (3) interviews with five e-textile educators to reflect on applications and to better understand the opportunities and limitations of using samplers for distance learning. This paper contributes a better understanding of how HCI researchers can incorporate craft pattern practices for learning hybrid craft techniques.",

While widely researched by the Wearable Computing community, e-textiles have yet to reach broad prevalence in the consumer market. A major obstacle lies in its scalable production. Specifically, moving from prototype to production remains elusive for individual researchers, makers, and startups. To better understand these challenges and pinpoint opportunities to reduce barriers, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 7 subject matter experts with experience in low volume production of e-textile products. We identified common challenges encountered during the prototype-to-production process and summarized our findings in four themes: (1) lack of production standards; (2) gaps between apparel and hardware manufacturing; (3) gaps in manufacturing costs vs. market expectations; and (4) lack of production-capable e-textile solutions. Our study revealed opportunities for future research on tools, materials, and community support specific to low-volume e-textile production. We envision that accessible low-volume e-textile production could enable more creators to bring their creations to the next step. ",

We have now developed a 2nd generation that allows long term recording in real life environments in conjunction with a low power Bluetooth enabled smart phone. It allows the system to move from the detection of individual swallows which is too unreliable for practical applications to an analysis of the statistical distribution of swallow frequency. Such an analysis allows the detection of \"nutrition events\" such as having lunch or breakfast. It also allows us to see the general level of activity and distinguish between just being absolutely quiet (no motion) and sleeping. The neckband can be useful in a variety of applications such as cognitive disease monitoring and elderly care.",

These buttons possess temporal forms that enable multi-sensory (haptic and visual) interactive feedforward and feedback. As the development of automated vehicles and intelligent systems progresses, these buttons serve as output compositions of the system, allowing expressivity in the interactions. By presenting experiential prototypes in this demonstration, we provide the automotive community an opportunity to engage with and explore tactile sensations.

The project is a two-month collaboration between the Verworner-Krause Kammerorchester (VKKO), technical and design researchers, currently still running. Preliminary analyses of the data recorded while the conductor is wearing the prototype demonstrate that the developed system can be used to robustly decode a large number of conducting and performative movements.

Effectively communicating such experiences is crucial for designing tactile fabric experiences. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding of the fabric tactile and affective experiences, preventing the development of tools to facilitate the communication of these experiences. In this paper, we examine the fabric experiences of 27 participants towards nine cotton samples. We combine qualitative and quantitative methods to create FabTouch, a novel tool to facilitate a dialogue in the design of fabric experiences. We found six phases of fabric touch experiences including fabric touch responses, sensory associations, and emotional responses. Initial feedback from designers suggested that FabTouch could enrich design processes both in practice and in education and can create inspiration for physical and digital design explorations. ",

While computer vision techniques aim to detect these gestures, they encounter obstacles like obfuscation and lighting conditions. Alternatively, wearable devices have leveraged interactive textiles to recognize arm gestures. However, these methods predominantly emphasize textile deformation-based interactions, like twisting or grasping the sleeve, rather than tracking the natural body movement.This study bridges this gap by introducing an e-textile sleeve system that integrates multiple ultra-sensitive graphene e-textile strain sensors in an arrangement that captures bending and twisting along with an inertia measurement unit into a sports sleeve. This paper documents a comprehensive overview of the sensor design, fabrication process, seamless interconnection method, and detachable hardware implementation that allows for reconfiguring the processing unit to other body parts. A user study with ten participants demonstrated that the system could classify six different fundamental arm gestures with over 90% accuracy.",

However, the installation of high-cost devices such as a camera or direct attachment of sensors on the subject's body present issues relating to the cost and convenience. As a solution, this paper develops a recognition algorithm for analyzing sleep postures using a smart pad with embedded fabric type pressure sensors. This algorithm is applied using a fabric-made smart pad with multiple pressure sensors. The sensors detect the distribution of the body pressure on the pad during sleeping, and the collected body pressure distribution data determines the sleep postures of the users. Further, this smart fabric pad does not require any additional analytical devices. This pad allows the users to monitor own sleep postures continuously. With the analyzed sleep posture data, the user can recognize one's typical sleep postures. In order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, this paper conducts an experiment to validate using the sleep posture data defined as nine categories. As a result, the algorithm had an average of 91.4% accuracy rate.",

It enables continuous input with high precision due to its innate haptic feedback and can be manufactured ready-made on a regular two-bed weft knitting machine, without requiring further post-processing steps. For our multi-component knit, we add resistive yarn to the filler material, in order to achieve a highly sensitive and responsive pressure sensing textile. Sensor resistance drops by ~90% when actuated with moderate finger pressure of 2\u00a0 N, making the sensor accessible also for straightforward readout electronics. We discuss related manufacturing parameters and their effect on shape and electrical characteristics and explore design opportunities to harness visual and tactile affordances. Finally, we demonstrate several application scenarios by implementing diverse spaceR variations, including analog rocker- and four-way directional buttons, and show the possibility of mode-switching by tracking temporal data.",

This requires multiple sensors to be worn at different locations as well as uncomfortable adhesives and discrete electronic components to be placed on the head. As a result, existing wearables either compromise comfort or compromise accuracy in tracking sleep variables. We propose PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure all the signals required for precise sleep stage tracking and to extract advanced sleep markers such as spindles and K-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography (PSG) and show that it significantly outperforms two commercially-available sleep tracking wearables\u2014Fitbit and Oura Ring.",

In this paper, we build on fluidic artificial muscles research to develop OmniFiber - a soft, line-based material system for designing movement-based interactions. We devised actuated thin (\u00f8outer < 1.8 mm) fluidic fibers with integrated soft sensors that exhibit perceivably strong forces, up to 19 N at 0.5 MPa, and a high speed of linear actuation peaking at 150mm/s. These allow to flexibly weave them into everyday tangible interactions; including on-body haptic devices for embodied learning, synchronized tangible interfaces for remote communication, and robotic crafting for expressivity. The design of such interactive capabilities is supported by OmniFiber\u2019s design space, accessible fabrication pipeline, and a fluidic I/O control system to bring omni-functional fluidic fibers to the HCI toolbox of interactive morphing materials.",

Referring to the national standard, the tensile fracture, burst performance and thickness tests of the fabric have been completed. The experimental results show that among the three primary weaves of plain weave, twill weave and satin weave, the satin weave fabric has the strongest tensile breaking and bursting performance; the thickness test result is that the plain weave fabric is the thinnest one. Among the changed weaves, the satin changed weave fabric has the strongest tensile breaking and bursting performance. The thickness test result shows that the thinnest flat is square plain fabric.

Studies have shown the potential these have to bring computational knowledge closer to new audiences. We address how eTextiles can approach a traditional textile art, specifically \u201cArpilleras\u201d from Chile, to understand how each field contributes from a symbolic, material and technical perspective. Following participatory approach methods and STEAM guidelines to create an educational program, we observed how eTextiles can influence the creation of soft interactive interfaces that enhance the communicative character and cultural heritage of a craft, and the potential of their use in a pedagogical context by using a specially designed kit. Our study suggests that connecting technology with strong cultural identity craft, can help to reach new audiences, revitalize the traditional technique, and create new tools for expression and creativity.

Human anthropometry is complex and varied, and for many applications, a single e-textile garment cannot accurately fit a variety of users. One such example is lower-limb rehabilitation applications, which rely on precise placement of sensors and actuators with respect to joints and muscles for each individual user. Here, we present the development of a multi-layer, stretchable, flexible e-textile system, which affords quick and easy repositioning of components on the garment surface.

Occupational therapists often use switches attached to electronics that activate the devices to give people with disabilities the ability to interact with toys and electronics. However, current switches on the market are expensive, break easily and are unable to customize. We ran two co-design workshops and follow-up interviews with 14 occupational therapists specializing in students with acquired brain injuries. In phase one, the occupation therapists built three soft switches and brainstormed iterations. In phase two, we gained valuable insights into the iterations from occupational therapists. This paper contributes to Human-Computer Interaction as a case study, designs guidelines to support co-design with occupational therapists, and discusses the potential of adaptive soft switches. This work contributes to the growing literature around supporting occupational therapists as makers and how researchers can support them during the co-design process.",

This work provides discussion and insight around the binding of material and sensor technologies with affect. We investigate how emotions could be mapped to our environment through textiles. We present two online surveys designed to enable people to map emotions to textiles. We then use the results of these surveys to inform and inspire the design of the Textile Mirror prototype, a 60x92 cm wall panel that is composed of industrial felt interlaced with Nitinol wire, and is designed to shift its textural structure upon receiving emotional signals from its viewer.",

Our prototype device consists of a custom multitouch capacitive sensor mounted on the back of a smartphone. Similar capabilities could be enabled on most existing capacitive touchscreens through low-level access to the capacitive sensor. We demonstrate how touch strokes can be used to initialize the device for interaction and how strokes can be processed to enable text recognition of characters written over the same physical area. We also contribute a comparative study that empirically measures how different fabrics attenuate touch inputs, providing insight for future investigations. Our results suggest that PocketTouch will work reliably with a wide variety of fabrics used in today's garments, and is a viable input method for quick eyes-free operation of devices in pockets.",

They are affected by the technological trend toward miniaturization of electronic devices [8]. Similarly, textile antennas are being embedded into clothing where they lay flat to the body, seamlessly integrated into the surface of the garment [7]. Yet the question arises whether textile antennas must be discrete and designed out of sight. In this paper we propose a possible alternative. Disobedient Antennas are textile interaction design examples using textile design and experimental research methods. They are textile receiver antennas that disrupt the convention of planar textile antennas [7,8] to suggest that textile antennas can be voluminous and sculptural wearable objects. Further, they occupy a performative space, suggesting body-space-object interaction by using the antennas to perceive and explore electromagnetic fields through sonic feedback. Their use opens to improvised movements and choreographies in response to electromagnetic space.",

The surface is made of a highly stretchable pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent, the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience expressive interactions as with any fabric based shape-changing interface. By using frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation and experimental results for the shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and form-factors. We present a working prototype of TableHop that has 30x40 cm2 surface area and uses a grid of 3x3 transparent electrodes. It uses a maximum of 9.46 mW and can create tactile vibrations of up to 20 Hz. TableHop can be scaled to make large interactive surfaces and integrated with other objects and devices. TableHop will improve user interaction experience on 2.5D deformable displays.",

This submission includes design and technical details, as well as initial interaction design scenarios. The next steps of this project will explore how these toys could support the development of empathy in toddlers through embodied play. Further work is needed in order to develop background research, collaborations with early childhood researchers, as well as empirical studies.

In a first experiment we determined an upper bound for the number of different angles users can reliably grab into a piece of fabric on their forearm. Our results show that users can, without looking at it, reliably grab fabric on their forearm with an average accuracy between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, which would provide up to six different menu options selectable with the initial pinch. In a second experiment, we show that our textile sensor, Grabrics, can detect fold angles at 45\u00b0 spacing with up to 85% accuracy. Our studies also found that user performance and workload are independent of the fabric types that were tested.",

Changes in posture translate to changes in pressure patterns across the surface of our clothing. We describe the construction of the textile pressure sensor and, using simple machine learning techniques on data gathered from 10 participants, demonstrate its ability to discriminate between 19 different basic posture types with high accuracy.

These sessions inspired participants (age 10-12) who tend to be uninterested and uncooperative in educational activities to complete interactive projects and engage with workshop volunteers as mentors and peers.

The ability of this technology to subtly and ubiquitously change the color of the fabric itself has made us able to merge different fields and technologies with AmbikKraf. In addition, with an animated room divider screen, Ambikraf merged its technology with Japanese Byobu art to tighten the gap between traditional arts and contemporary technologies. Through few this AmbiKraf Byobu art installation and other installations we discuss the impact of this technology as a ubiquitous fabric display. With focus to improvements of some limitations of the existing system, we present our future vision that enables us to merge this technology into more applications fields thus making this technology a platform for ubiquitous interactions on our daily peripherals.",

In the realm of personal architecture, bYOB is an interactive material that encourages users to explore and experiment by creating new objects to seamlessly integrate into their lives. The physical configuration of the object mediates its computational behavior. Therefore, an object built out of the system of modular elements understands its geometry and responds appropriately without any end-user programming. Our current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech. We describe how bYOB contributes to and differs from existing work in modular based systems and fabric interfaces. We discuss our development process in respect to physical, electronic, and conceptual design. We also describe salient features and future applications enabled by this new construction kit.",

We designed e-textile projects with strategically poor crafting, non-functional circuitry, and insufficient coding to investigate high school students' understanding of coding, circuit design and creation (through sewing) with the LilyPad Arduino. We videotaped and analyzed ten students collaborating in pairs as they engaged in debugging, or fixing, various problems in provided e-textile artifacts. Our findings indicate that these deconstruction kit projects are not only promising tools for evaluating students' understanding of e-textiles but can also become valuable learning tools on their own, especially when peer collaboration is taken into account.",

Unlike the common \"sensor sandwich\" approach used in previous work, ZebraSense inherently minimizes the number of sensing elements, which drastically simplifies both sensor construction and its integration into soft goods, while preserving maximum sensor resolution. The experimental evaluation confirmed the validity of our approach and demonstrated that ZebraSense is a reliable, efficient, and accurate solution for detecting user gestures in various dual-sided interaction scenarios, allowing for new use cases in smart apparel, home decoration, toys, and other textile objects.",

Current medical spirometers are insufficient for such usage because they force uncomfortable conditions for users, such as pinching their noses with a clip and holding a mouthpiece in their mouths. To solve this issue, we propose an e-textile-based wearable spirometer called SpiroVest that estimates lung behavior from torso-girth movements. It does not require any uncomfortable conditions that interfere with daily activity. In addition, our wearable spirometer is able to estimate accurate respiratory volume against variety of postures by a simple and posture-independent error reduction mechanism.",

This workshop provides a novel perspective: skills that are often labeled 'women's work' are the foundational principles of computer science developed from textile crafts. The 'Code Crafters' curriculum, which expands Andrea Mayer's Snap-based TurtleStitch embroidery programming project, is being successfully taught in 3 ways: as a full semester undergraduate course, as a weeklong summer workshop for middle and high school students, and as a half day event. The SIGCSE workshop will introduce participants to potential adaptations of this curriculum, report on its use as both a CS 0, and CS 1 course, and give participants hands-on experience in designing and rendering a machine embroidery pattern in TurtleStitch and Processing Stitch (Java). Key concepts from the full semester curriculum will be demonstrated: (1) crocheting is a vehicle for learning about primitive operations instruction codes for process control, and reading and writing patterns (algorithms); (2) programing machine embroidery provides exposure to agile design; (3) contrasting embroidery with quilting provides experience in abstraction and reuse; (4) weaving and tapestry provide concrete illustrations of manipulating two dimensional data structures; (5) studying embroidery machine file formats demonstrates how language translation takes place; (6) sharing a limited resource (a $500 programmable, single thread embroidery machine) provides concrete experience in scheduling, and product testing; (7) collaborative crochet and quilted projects provide experience in team dynamics. Participants should bring a laptop, and will be invited to join an online community of mutual support.",

Despite the great progress in embedded technology, artificial interfaces, such as remote controls and touch screens, remain the dominant media for interacting with smart everyday objects. Motivated by recent advancements in smart textile technologies, we investigate the usability and acceptance of fabric-based controllers in the smart home environment. In this article we describe the development and evaluation of three textile interfaces for controlling a motorized recliner armchair in a living room setting. The core of this contribution is the empirical study with twenty participants that contrasted the user experience of three textile-based interaction techniques to a standard remote control. Despite the slightly lower reliability of the textile interfaces, their overall acceptance was higher. The study shows that the hedonic quality and attractiveness of textile interfaces have higher impact on user acceptance compared to pragmatic qualities, such as efficiency, fluidity of interaction, and reliability. Attractiveness profits from the direct and nearly invisible integration of the interaction device into textile objects such as furniture.",

Unfortunately for students working with Arduino devices, there are no debugger tools built into the Arduino IDE. Instead, a student would have to move onto a professional IDE like Atmel Studio and/or acquire a hardware debugger. Except, these options have a steep learning curve and are not intended for a student who has just started to learn how to write code. I am developing an Arduino software library, called Pin Status, to assist novice programmers with debugging common logic errors and provide features specific to the e-textile microcontroller, Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic. These features include a breakpoint method which pauses an Arduino program's execution and offers, via Serial communication, a menu for viewing and/or updating the current value of digital pins and \"watched\" variables. On the Adafruit Circuit Playground Classic, the library also uses on-board LEDs to show the current value of the digital pins (High/Low). This work has been funded by NSF STEM+C, award #1742081.",

Two iterative prototypes were manufactured and tested in two user studies, focusing on mechanical aspects of the design for applications in capturing body movement within social interaction. We report on failures and risks of the design, and furthermore propose solutions for a more robust, yet soft wearable sensing system.",

When the chaser is in close proximity to the token player, the token jumps to the shirt of the second closest player, making this children's game more challenging for adult players.

Unlike conventional wearable IMU MoCap based on inverse dynamics, MoCaPose decouples the sensor position from the pose system. MoCaPose uses a deep regressor to continuously predict the 3D upper body joints coordinates from 16-channel textile capacitive sensors, unbound by specific applications. The concept is implemented through two prototyping iterations to first solve the technical challenges, then establish the textile integration through fashion-technology co-design towards a design-centric smart garment. A 38-hour dataset of synchronized video and capacitive data from 21 participants was recorded for validation. The motion tracking result was validated on multiple levels from statistics (R2 ~ 0.91) and motion tracking metrics (MP JPE ~ 86mm) to the usability in pose and motion recognition (0.9 F1 for 10-class classification with unsupervised class discovery). The design guidelines impose few technical constraints, allowing the wearable system to be design-centric and usecase-specific. Overall, MoCaPose demonstrates that textile-based capacitive sensing with its unique advantages, can be a promising alternative for wearable motion tracking and other relevant wearable motion recognition applications.",

Our aim is to leverage continuous EMG data of the masticatory muscles for monitoring daily activities. For motion artifact reduction, which is a major problem for measuring EMG with textile electrodes, we propose a new algorithm based on kinesiology by utilizing a correlation coefficient between the root mean square of the right side EMG and that of the left side EMG.

However, approaches for monitoring HR, either depend on complex visualizations on small screens (i.e., smartwatches) or intrusive modalities (i.e. haptic, auditory) that might force the attention to the information. We developed an early prototype, Howel, a novel wrist-worn soft wearable to display HR zone information during CT. Our concept utilizes mapping information onto dynamic patterns (color changing stripes) as an easy-to-understand ambient display. To preserve non-intrusiveness, it uses non-emissive modality by heating thermochromic paints on its textile surfaces. Early feedback from three participants suggests that soft wearables with non- emissive dynamic patterns have potential (1) to embed information organically on the body, (2) to give easy-to-understand in-situ intensity information and (3) to keep the attention on the exercise instead of performance measures.",

They are particularly relevant to densely populated cities where most people live in compact spaces. This proposed research explores interactive interior textile surfaces as an adaptive media which can transform interiors via the change of colors, luminescence and surface design. This is done by investigating the integration of textile base material via embellishment techniques, such as embroidery and felting, with polymeric photonic fibers (POF) which enhance tactile quality without compromising on the technological functionality. Their flexible application methods mean that, it is adaptable to the rigid nature of polymeric photonic fibers. In addition, embroidery has the unique ability to arrange and combine threads together with various materials in non-rigid formations and multiple directions to create stable two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms [1]. Different materials can be combined to explore aesthetically pleasing surface designs, textures and achieve positive tactile quality.",

        "abstract_full": "Cycling is an efficient and effective way to improve one's overall fitness level, such as cardiovascular fitness, stamina, lower body strength, and body fat percentage. To improve fitness performance, real-time cycling fitness tracking can not only allow cyclists to better control their energy outputs but also help push workout intensity and keep users accountable for their fitness progress. However, existing bike sensors (e.g., the ones mounted to bike's wheel hub or crank arm) are only limited to measuring cycling cadence and speed. Although several recent studies relying on on-body sensors or cameras can provide more fine-grained information (e.g., riding position and knee joint angle), they would either require inconvenient setups or raise serious privacy concerns. To circumvent these limitations, in this paper, we propose SmarCyPad, an innovative smart seat pad that can continuously and unobtrusively track five cycling-specific metrics, including cadence, per-leg stability, leg strength balance, riding position, and knee joint angle of the cyclist. Specifically, we embed conductive fabric sensors in the seat pad to sense the pressure applied to the bike's seat exerted by the cyclist's gluteal muscles. A series of signal processing algorithms are developed to estimate the pedaling period from the sensed pressure signal and further derive the cycling cadence, per-leg stability, and leg strength balance. Additionally, we leverage a deep learning model to detect the cyclist's riding position and reconstruct the cyclist's knee joint angles via linear regression. The sensors and the system prototype are manufactured from scratch leveraging off-the-shelf materials, and the total cost is less than $50. Extensive experiments involving 15 participants demonstrate that SmarCyPad can accurately estimate the cycling cadence with an average error of 1.13 rounds per minute, quantify the cycling stability for each leg, detect cycling imbalance, distinguish five riding positions with an accuracy of 96.60%, and continuously track the knee joint angle with an average mean error as low as 9.58 degrees.",

We are investigating new approaches to support younger children (K-4) in the creative design, play, and customization of e-textiles and wearables without requiring the creation of code. This demo paper presents one such example of ongoing work: MakerShoe, an e-textile platform for designing shoe-based interactive wearable experiences.

In this paper, we explore the material culture of textile goldwork to better understand how e-textile researchers can leverage their material properties, palette, and practices. First, we provide a historical background of English goldwork to give HCI researchers context on this craft field including technological and cultural influences. Then, we interview 13 contemporary goldwork practitioners on their creative practice to better understand the tools, techniques, and skills they employ. Our study findings show how goldwork practitioners deal with the unique constraints of metal threads and materials, and how these materials need to be handled differently than regular non-metal threads and fibers. This paper contributes an analysis of goldwork practices for HCI audiences with suggestions on how we can leverage these practices for the future of e-textile hybrid crafts.",
